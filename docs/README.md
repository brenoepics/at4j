# Documentation for AT4J

## Contributing

This site is built with [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.


## Working on the content

- See VitePress docs on supported [Markdown Extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown).
